Quickero makes your favorite apps available directly in the notification overview. This way you can reach them even faster.

Some devices with a fingerprint sensor on the back offer a setting that allows you to open the notification overview with a swipe gesture on the fingerprint sensor. This is how Quickero unfolds its full potential!
Settings -> System -> Gestures -> Swipe fingerprint for notifications
